# Weather-Dashboard
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. I to built this weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.  I used the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. I read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. I used `localStorage` to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys).
